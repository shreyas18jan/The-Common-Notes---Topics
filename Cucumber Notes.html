Cucumber is a tool that supports BDD. Here, the executable specifications are written in plain text called Gherkin (set of grammar rules). Gherkin files are stored with .feature extension.<br>
<br>
Specifications consists of multiple scenarios, each scenario is list of steps. Each step talks about the action to be performed on it.<br>
<br>
Step definition helps Gherkins steps to connect to programming code. Step definition carries out the action mentioned in the step.<br>
<br><br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Example Snippet</b></button>
<div class="content">

    @When("^User Login$")
    public void user_login_pressed() throws Throwable {
    &emsp;driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//*[@id='login']")).click();
    }

</div><br>

<br>
Gherkin uses keywords to give the structure and meaning to the executable specifications. Following are the keywords:<br>
1. <b>Feature</b><br>
2. <b>Example (or Scenario)</b><br>
3. <b>Given, When, Then, And, But for steps (or *)</b><br>
4. <b>Background</b><br>
5. <b>Scenario Outline (or Scenario Template)</b><br>
6. <b>Examples (or Scenarios)</b><br>
7. <b>Rule</b><br>
<br>
There are a few secondary keywords as well:<br>
1. <b>"""</b> (Doc Strings)<br>
2. <b>|</b> (Data Tables)<br>
3. <b>@</b> (Tags)<br>
4. <b>#</b> (Comments)<br>
<br>
Either spaces or tabs may be used for indentation. The recommended indentation level is two spaces.<br>
<br><br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Example Snippet</b></button>
<div class="content">

    Feature: Is prime number?

    &emsp;# This example checks whether the number is prime or not
    &emsp;Scenario: Check whether 27 is prime number or not
    &nbsp;&emsp;Given start the Prime Checker
    &nbsp;&emsp;When input value is 27
    &nbsp;&emsp;Then entered number is a prime number

    &emsp;Scenario: Check whether 25 is prime number or not
    &nbsp;&emsp;Given start the Prime Checker
    &nbsp;&emsp;When input value is 25
    &nbsp;&emsp;Then entered number is not a prime number

</div><br>

<br>Here, after keyword each statement is matched to a code block called Step Definition.<br>
<br>
1. <b style="color:Tomato;">Feature:</b><br>
- To group related scenarios.<br>
- Provides a high-level description of a software feature.<br>
- Should always be the First keyword in the document. Description is optional.<br>
<br><br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Example Snippet</b></button>
<div class="content">

    Feature: Is prime number?

    &emsp;Prime numbers are special numbers, greater than 1, that have exactly two factors, themselves and 1.
    &emsp;19 is a prime number. It can only be divided by 1 and 19.
    &emsp;The prime numbers below 20 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.

</div><br>

<br>
2. <b style="color:Tomato;">Example:</b><br>
- The keyword Scenario is a synonym of the keyword Example.<br>
- Collection of steps(actions to be carried out). Recommended to have not more than 5 steps.<br>
- Pattern reference : Describe an initial context (Given steps), Describe an event (When steps) and Describe an expected outcome (Then steps).<br>
<br>
3. <b style="color:Tomato;">Steps:</b><br>
- Each step starts with Given, When, Then, And, or But.<br>
- In Sequence, one at a time, steps are executed in a scenario. During execution, the step definition is searched.<br>
- Keywords are not taken into account when looking for a step definition.<br>
<br>
&emsp;> <b>Given</b> : Puts the system in a known state before the user (or external system) starts interacting with the system (in further steps).<br>
&emsp;> <b>When</b> : To describe an event, or an action. This step is interacting with the system, or it can be an event triggered by another system.<br>
&emsp;> <b>Then</b> : To describe an expected outcome, or result. This is our Assertion step.<br>
&emsp;> <b>And, But</b> : We use these keywords If you have successive GivenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, WhenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, or ThenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.<br>
&emsp;> <b>*</b> : Helpful when you have some steps that are effectively a list of things.<br>
<br>
4. <b style="color:Tomato;">Background:</b><br>
- A Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it.<br>
- It can contain one or more Given steps, which are run before each scenario.<br>
- A Background is placed before the first Scenario/Example, at the same level of indentation.<br>
<br>
5. <b style="color:Tomato;">Scenario outline and Examples:</b><br>
- The Scenario Outline keyword can be used to run the same Scenario multiple times, with different combinations of values.<br>
- A Scenario Outline must contain an Examples keyword.<br>
- The steps can use &lt;&gt; delimited parameters that reference headers in the examples table. Cucumber will replace these parameters with values from the table before it tries to match the step against a step definition.<br>
<br><br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>Example Snippet</b></button>
<div class="content">

    &emsp;Scenario Outline: Is prime number?
    &nbsp;&emsp;Given start the Prime Checker
    &nbsp;&emsp;When input value is &lt;input&gt;
    &nbsp;&emsp;Then entered number is a &lt;result&gt; number

    &emsp;Examples:
    &nbsp;&emsp;| input |  result  |
    &nbsp;&emsp;|    27 |   prime  |
    &nbsp;&emsp;|    25 | not prime|

</div><br>

<br>
Doc Strings are handy for passing a larger piece of text to a step definition.<br>
<br>
Data Tables are handy for passing a list of values to a step definition.<br>
<br>
Language header on the first line of a feature file tells Cucumber what spoken language to use - for example # language: fr for French. If you omit this header, Cucumber will default to English (en).<br>
<br>
<b>CucumberOptions for execution - </b> Using @CucumberOptions annotations in Runner Class, we can achieve few more customization.<br><br>
1. <b style="color:Tomato;">Plugin</b> option : different formatting options for the output reports can be changed here.<br>
- <b>plugin = {"pretty"}</b> : For additional colors and stack traces for errors.<br>
- <b>plugin ={"html:target/html/"}</b> : Generates a HTML report at the mentioned location.<br>
- <b>plugin = {"json:target/cucumber.json"}</b> : File contains all the information recorded in json format during the execution. This can be used later for any reporting enhancements.<br>
- <b>plugin = {"junit:target/cucumberReport.xml"}</b> : File contains all the information recorded in xml format during the execution. This can be used later for any reporting enhancements.<br>
plugin option allows any / all above entries can be used at the same time.<br>
<br>
2. <b style="color:Tomato;">dryRun</b> option : Checks whether corresponding Step definition exists or not for a step written in feature file. By default value is false.<br>
<br>
3. <b style="color:Tomato;">strict</b> option : If there is no stepDefinition present, should the testing be proceeded or not. By default value is true.<br><br>
4. <b style="color:Tomato;">monochrome</b> option : Makes Console output of Cucumber execution more readable. By default value is false.<br><br>
5. <b style="color:Tomato;">features</b> option : Cucumber checks the feature files in the mentioned directory.<br><br>
6. <b style="color:Tomato;">glue</b> option : Similar to features option, Cucumber checks the StepDefinition files in the mentioned directory.<br><br>
7. <b style="color:Tomato;">Snippets</b> option : Generates code snippets in Underscore style(SnippetType.UNDERSCORE) or CamelCase style(SnippetType.CAMELCASE). Default is Underscore style.<br><br>
8. <b style="color:Tomato;">tags</b> option : Can be used when specifying what tests to run.<br>
- <b>tags ={"@Regression"}</b> : Runs only tests which has Regression.<br>
- <b>tags ={"@Regression","@Functional"}</b> : Runs list of tests that needs to be executed.<br>
