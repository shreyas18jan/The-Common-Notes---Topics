<br>

<h2> Monolithic Application:</h2><br>
The Monolithic application represents Single Codebase - Where the application will have different layers like Presentation Layer, Service Layer , Data layer etc as a single war/jar file for deployment.<br>
Approach is Centralized Governance, the modules are tightly coupled as one single war/jar file.<br>
<br>
<b>Other Drawbacks:</b><br>
- As features are added, war/jar file becomes larger and difficult to maintain.<br>
- For a small change whole Application needs to be redeployed.<br>
- One issue can bring down the entire application/service to halt.<br>
<br>
<h2>MicroServices:</h2><br>
Micro Services architecture is a variant of Service Oriented Architecture where Application is broken into Independently Developed, Independently Deployable and Independently Testable services.<br>
Based on the Business Capabilities services are organized. These services talk to each other over the network to fulfill a request.<br>
Since the approach is Decentralizing control/governance, Changes to one service don't always require changing all other services. When change is required in a certain part of the application, only the related service can be modified and redeployed. No need to modify and redeploy the entire application.<br>
<br>
<b>Other Benefits:</b><br>
- Easy for Maintaining and Deploying.<br>
- Since this is a modular approach, Business re-usability is achieved.<br>
- Different technologies can be adopted for different MicroServices.<br>
<br>
<b>Drawbacks:</b><br>
- Complexity increases as the Micro Services increases.<br>
- Influences Network Latency because of frequent interaction between services.<br>
- Debugging becomes challenging as the control flows between services.<br>

    <tr>
        <td>In Monolithic applications the logging will happen in a single file - Easy to check and understand.</td>
        <td>Logging happens in different microservices, Takes time to trace a execution flow.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Scaling is easy , since a copy of an application has to be deployed.</td>
        <td>Complexity increases as it is not easy system to administer (Example in Kubernetes Cluster).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Turn around time for Monolithic Application takes time since the entire application has to be deployed.</td>
        <td>More Reliable since bring up the replacement service will be quick.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Throughput is faster in Monolithic as services doesn't have network latency.</td>
        <td>Compared to Monolithic , micro services might deliver lesser throughput.</td>
